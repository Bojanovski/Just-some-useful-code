# Just-some-useful-code
Bunch of code that has been used, reused and fairly optimized during the years.
Although the code should be in a good shape, I will be happy to receive any code reviews so feel free to send some.
Everything is written in C++11 along with STL.

Big portion of this code was used in Starpoint Gemini Warlords: (http://store.steampowered.com/app/419480/Starpoint_Gemini_Warlords/)
